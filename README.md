# Image-Forging-Detection
This project uses block-based techniques to develop an algorithm for detecting forged or duplicated regions within digital images. Using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantization, and shift vector analysis, the algorithm identifies suspicious regions indicative of image manipulation. Implemented in Python, the algorithm provides command-line parameterization and incorporates visualization techniques for better understanding. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately detecting forged regions, contributing to digital image forensics by preserving integrity and authenticity.
